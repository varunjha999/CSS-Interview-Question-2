    <h1>CSS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS (Day 2) </h1>
    
    <b>Ques8. What is box sizing?</b>
    <p>Ans.<br>
        <div class="test">  
 Box-sizing property defines how the width and height gets applied on an element. <br>
 Default value of box-sizing is content-box, in this case the actual width of the box will be equal to the border and<br>
 padding and width of the box ( Actual width : width + border + padding ). In case when box-sizing is set to be border-box,<br>
 then the actual width will be equal to the width of the box itself. Means if we will increase the padding or border of <br>
 the box then it will not increase the width of the box.<br>

a)    content-box (Default)
b)    border-box <br>

-Used to change the height and width of element.<br>
-Width and height of an element is calculated like this:<br>
 width + padding + border = actual width of an element<br>
 height + padding + border = actual height of an element<br>

    <b>Ques9. What is animation delay?</b>
    <p>Ans.<br>
        <div class="test">
        -This property tells us about the delay in the start of an animation.<br>
        animation-delay value is defines is milliseconds(ms).<br>
        This allows an animation to begin execution some time after it is applied.<br>
        It is a sub-property of CSS animation. It defines how long the animation has to wait before starting. <br>
        Using the animation-delay property, you define the delay by specifying the number of seconds or milliseconds<br>
        it should take before playing.

    </div>


    <b>Ques10. Which property you will use to merge cells vertically in grid?</b>
    <p>Ans.<br>
        <div class="test">
   (CSS grid-column proprty).grid-column-start and grid-column-end property can be used to merge cells vertically.<br>
    It also has a shorthand i.e., grid-column: start/end. If you want to merge two elements in row then we will have<br>
    to use grid-row property inside the child element. Remember these properties are applicable only to child elements<br>
    not to parent elements.

    </p><br><br>
    </div>


    <b>Ques11. Which property you will use to merge cells horizontally in grid?</b>
    <p>Ans.<br>
        <div class="test">
     grid-row-start and grid-row-end property can be used to merge cells horizontally. It <br>
     also has a shorthand i.e., grid-row: grid-row-start/grid-row-end;<br>
     
    </p><br><br>
</div>

    <b>Ques12. Explain CSS box model</b>
    <p>Ans.<br>
        <div class="test">
        The box model in CSS is a set of rules that determine how your web page is rendered on the internet. <br>
        In this model, a rectangular box is generated for HTML elements. This box consists of first content, <br>
        then padding, then border, and finally margin.<br>

    </p><br><br>
</div>

    <b>ques13. What is the diffrence between display none and visibility hidden?</b>
    <p>Ans.<br>
        <div class="test">
    display: none; <br>
    The display: none property is used to hide elements without deleting them. It does not take up any space.<br>
    In this case, the tag is removed from the page, which allows other elements to fill in.<br>
    visibility: hidden;<br>
    The visibility: hidden property also hides an element, but affects the layout i.e., it takes up the space.<br>
    The element is hidden from view but not the page flow. <br>
    -VISIBILTY HIDDEN- It is not visible but gets up its original space whereas,<br>
    -DISPLAY NONE- It is hidden takes no space</p><br>
